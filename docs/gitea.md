[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) is a community managed lightweight code hosting
solution written in Go. It's the best self hosted Github alternative in my
opinion.

# [Installation](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-with-docker-rootless/)

Gitea provides automatically updated Docker images within its Docker Hub
organisation.

## Using Docker Compose


## Connect with OICD

Gitea [doesn't yet support the mapping of OICD groups to
organizations](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/10016).
